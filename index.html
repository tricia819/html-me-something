					<strong>Online Fiber-Art Magazines</strong><br>
						There are several fiber magazines to which you can turn for fun information and great patterns. Many of the very best reside online only. While this may not seem like a good fit, it is actually perfect. It allows you to search through the patterns and print out only the ones you plan on using thereby saving tons of paper and ink. <p>
	
						<a href="http://www.knitty.com">Knitty.com</a> - By far, this is the best online knitting magazine ever. Published 6times a year, it includes how-to articles, book and product reviews, and a stunning array of patterns, all of which are in sizes from Small to 3X (sometimes 4X and 5X.) <br>
						<a href="http://www.anticraft.com">Anti-Craft.com</a> - Another online crafting magazine like Knitty but, this one also includes crochet, sewing, and cooking among other crafts and all the projects are a little on the wild side. For instance, one of their most popular patterns was “The Snat chel” a little purse made to look like a vu! va. is that you pay a small fee for the pattern and that is used to pay the designers a fair rate for the time and effort they put into creating a pattern, something that rarely happens, online or “IRL.” <br>

					<strong>Fiber Arts meets Social Networking</strong><br>
						<a href="http://www.ravelry.com">Ravelry.com</a> - The mother ship of fiber artists, Ravelry has it all. When you want to connect with other artists all over the world, this is the place to go. You can search through hundreds of thousands of patterns, document your stash, tools, and projects, buy and sell all manner of stitchery related items and join the forums. The pattern search engine allows you to search by type (knit or crochet), cost (free or pay), garment size, gender, yarn size, hook or needle size, style of garment and several other options. <p>
						<a href="http://www.Meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> - If you are looking for a group of like-minded people to get together with in real life instead of online, this is the place to go. Meetup is a clearing house for all sorts of groups that meet face-to-face, usually in a public location though some groups meet at a member’s home. Whether you are looking for a knitting/crochet group, a book club, a social club, a religious/atheist group or a hiking group, Meetup is the place to find it. It is also a good place to check if you are planning a vacation since groups are located all over the country. <p>

					<strong>Knitting Techniques Classes </strong><p>

						<u>Knitting 1 – Where To Begin –</u> 3 hours – Have you always wanted a Dr. Who scarf but, can’t find someone who wants to make you one? In this class you will learn everything you need to know to make one for yourself. Learn how to cast-on, knit, purl, and bind off. This is a fast paced class, please come prepared to work hard and learn a lot. All supplies will be provided. You will be making a coaster and will have enough yarn left over to make 2 or 3 more at home. When you are done with that, you can use the techniques you learned and the pattern in your supply kit to start on that epic Dr. Who scarf! <p>

						<u>Knitting 2 – A Stitch In Time: Recognizing and Fixing Your Mistakes</u> – 3 hours – So, you just learned how to knit and you have been working away but, what you are making looks nothing like the picture. You may have more or less stitches than you are supposed to have or, your project may be full of holes and bumps. Worst of all, maybe you have a tangled mess because your cat decided that your knitting project was the perfect play-toy and you must be making it just for her!  If any of this sounds familiar, you need this class. Better yet, take the course BEFORE you start making mistakes! <p>

						<u>Knitting 3 – Beyond The Basics –</u> 3 hours – You know how to knit and purl, you can fix your mistakes and now you want to start tackling patterns but, they are written in some sort of alien language, mention increasing and decreasing or, worse yet, they show what can only be described as hieroglyphics on graph paper. What’s a knitter to do?!? Take a class, that’s what. In this class you will learn how to read patterns and charts as well as several methods for increasing and decreasing. You will also learn when and how to join a new ball of yarn to your project. <p>
	
						<u>Knitting 4 – Ninja Knitting - Knitting In The Round –</u> 3 hours - This class will teach you how to work with circular needles and DPNs (double pointed needles). This is when people start to pay attention to what you are doing and think that you must be a ninja to be able to knit with 5 needles at once, little do they know, it really isn’t that hard. In this class you will learn to make tubes without having to sew. What can you make with a tube? Sweaters, extra warm scarves, hats, dresses, skirts, gloves, the possibilities are endless. You will be making a baby hat that requires you to know how to “ssk” and “k2tog.” <p>

					<strong>Things to keep in mind when learning to knit:</strong><br>
						Relax and be patient, you will make mistakes, expect them and go with the flow. Don’t obsess. There are a few different methods of knitting. The two most common methods are English (feeder yarn in right hand) and Continental (feeder yarn in left hand). <p> <p>
	
						<u>Casting On -</u> There are dozens of ways to cast on but, the three most common types are:

						<ol>

							<li>Cable Method – no tail, good for last minute additions.</li>

							<li>Thumb Method – long tail, quick but, tends to be tight.</li>

							<li>Knit-on – long tail, a little slower but looser. <br>
							    When using a Long Tail method, start with a tail that is 3 times length of the finished object, plus 6 inches.</li><p>

						</ol>
						
						<u>Knit Stitch (k)</u>  - When making a knit stitch, hold the needle with your stitches in your left hand and the empty needle in your right hand. There is a rhyme that, while written for children is sometimes helpful even for adults when they are just begining to knit... "In through the front door, run around the back, out through the window, off jumps Jack." Knit stitches are worked off of the left needle and onto the right. The needle is placed in the work from front to back. <p> <p>

						<u>Purl Stitch (p)</u>  - When making a purl stitch, hold the needles the same way as when you are making a knit stitch. Purl stitches are also worked off of the left needle and onto the right. The difference comes when placing the needle in the work and you do this from the back to the front. <p>

						<u>Binding-Off (BO)</u> - The bind off edge should look similar to the cast-on edge. To bind off, knit first two stitches then pass first stitch over second (right over left) and off of needle.<p>
	
						<u>Types of Yarn</u> – Yarn comes in a variety of weights, materials and content. <p>

						<u>Types of Needles</u> – Needles also come with a variety of options. The three you see most often are straight needles, double pointed needles (DPNs) and circular. Other needle attributes are length (ex. 29"), girth (ex. US Size 4, UK Size 9, 3.5mm). Note: All the sizes in the previous example are the same size of needle. Search the internet for a size comparison chart if you are unsure of what size needle you have or need. <p>
	
						<u>Basic Pattern Stitches</u> – Garter Stitch (knit all rows), Stockinette (K 1 row, P1 row), Ribbing (k1,p1) where the same stitches line up. Note: all these examples refer to knitting on straight needles. Things are a bit different when knitting "in-the-round.<p>
	
						<u>Gauge</u> - Gauge is important when knitting something that has to FIT. If you are making a scarf or a placemat or a washcloth, guage is less important. Guage is a way of comparing the size of the thing you are making to the size of the thing the pattern designer made. If you are making a sweater, it is important that it fit and so, guage is something you HAVE to pay attention to.<p>

					<strong>Things to keep in mind when learning to crochet:</strong><br>

						Relax and be patient. You will make mistakes, expect them and go with the flow. Don’t obsess. Crochet uses a hook which is held in the right hand and the feeder yarn is held in the left hand. Crochet is more flexible than knitting. It can be easily used to make free-form designs (scrumbling).<p> <p>

						<u>Chain Stitch (ch)</u> - The chain stitch is the foundation of most crochet projects – often called the “foundation chain.” When working back and forth, it consists of enough stitches to span the base of the project plus, a few extra to simulate (fake) the first vertical stitch of the first row (turning chain). <p>

						<u>Slip Stitch (sl)</u> – Unlike all other stitches, the slip stich requires no turning chains. To make a slip stitch, draw up a stitch and pull it through the loop on the hook. The slip stitch is rarely used on its own. Generally used to join rounds or move the hook and yarn across a group of existing stitches and into a new position. <p>

						<u>Single Crochet (sc)</u> – Requires 1 turning chain. To make a single crochet, draw up a stitch, yarn over and pull through both loops. <p>
	
						<u>Double Crochet (dc)</u> – Requires 3 turning chains. To make a double crochet, yarn over (2 loops on hook), draw up a stitch (3 loops on hook), yarn over and pull through two (2 loops left on hook), yarn over and pull through two (1 loop left on hook). <p>

						<u>Types of Yarn</u> – Yarn comes in a variety of weights, materials and content. <p>

						<u>Types of Hooks</u> – Hooks also come with a variety of options including Afghan and Tunision Crochet. Hooks can be made from plastic, aluminum, and wood. Some are even ergonomic! As with knitting needles, crochet hooks are sold with different sizes. Hooks used for yarn are sized with letters and those used for thread are sized with numbers (and usually made of steel because they are so fine.) If you have any question about sizes, refer to the mm sizes, they are the most reliable. <p>

						<u>Methods of Working</u> - There are two methods of crocheting: working back and forth in rows is good for squares and rectangles while, working in circles can allow you to make Motifs or tubes (ideal for sweaters, hats and bags). <p>
	
						<u>Gauge</u> - Gauge is important when knitting something that has to FIT. If you are making a scarf or a placemat or a washcloth, guage is less important. Guage is a way of comparing the size of the thing you are making to the size of the thing the pattern designer made. If you are making a sweater, it is important that it fit and so, guage is something you HAVE to pay attention to.<p>
